# Progress

## What Works
- Unified configuration page with user token input and admin-protected advanced options.
- Backend integration for subscription validation and Premiumize key management.
- Dynamic updating of Premiumize API keys within the config's services array.
- Stream resolution logic performs subscription checks and updates credentials as needed.
- Premiumize wrappers retrieve keys from the updated config structure.
- Robust error messaging for subscription and key retrieval failures.

## What's Left to Build
- Further enhancements to error handling and user feedback.
- Expansion of backend API for additional service integrations.
- Continued UI/UX improvements for configuration workflows.
- Additional documentation for backend endpoints and integration.

## Current Status
- Major backend and frontend integration complete.
- Core credential management and subscription validation features are functional.
- System architecture and config management patterns have been updated.

## Known Issues
- Potential edge cases in error handling may require further refinement.
- Additional backend features and integrations are planned.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Shifted from frontend-only credential management to secure backend handling.
- Adopted admin authentication for advanced configuration.
- Centralized sensitive operations to improve security and maintainability.
- Refined encryption strategy: encryption/decryption for `services` and `apiKey` was removed to reduce complexity and maintenance overhead; only `userToken` and `adminPassword` are now encrypted/decrypted, as these are the primary authentication credentials.
